# Laravel + React Starter Kit

## Introduction

Our React starter kit provides a robust, modern starting point for building Laravel applications with a React frontend using [Inertia](https://inertiajs.com).

Inertia allows you to build modern, single-page React applications using classic server-side routing and controllers. This lets you enjoy the frontend power of React combined with the incredible backend productivity of Laravel and lightning-fast Vite compilation.

This React starter kit utilizes React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4, and [Untitled UI](https://www.untitledui.com/) components.

## Getting Started

```bash
composer install
npm install
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate
```

To start the development server:

```bash
composer run dev
```

This concurrently starts the Laravel server, queue worker, log viewer (Pail), and Vite dev server.

## Composer Packages

### nunomaduro/essentials [github](https://github.com/nunomaduro/essentials)
> Provides better defaults for your Laravel applications.

What it does:
- Strict Models
- Auto Eager Loading
- Optional Unguarded Models
- Immutable Dates
- Force HTTPS
- Safe Console
- Asset Prefetching
- Prevent Stray Requests
- Fake Sleep

### laravel/pint [github](https://github.com/laravel/pint)
> Laravel Pint is an opinionated PHP code style fixer for minimalists.

Code style fixer configured with `pint.json` file.

### rector-laravel [github](https://github.com/driftingly/rector-laravel)
> Rector instantly upgrades and refactors the PHP code of your application.

rector-laravel uses Rector and adds extra rules for Laravel. It automates upgrading your code to the latest version of PHP and Laravel and does auto-refactoring based on the rules in `rector.php`.

### phpstan and larastan [github](https://github.com/nunomaduro/larastan)
> Larastan focuses on finding errors in your code. It catches whole classes of bugs even before you write tests for the code.

Configured with `phpstan.neon`. This project uses level 6.

## Testing

This project uses PHPUnit for testing.

```bash
composer test              # Run full test suite (lint + tests)
php artisan test --compact # Run tests only
```

## Git Hooks (Pre-commit & Pre-push)

This project uses [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) to automate code quality checks before commits and pushes. These hooks ensure consistent code quality across the team.

### Pre-commit Hook

Runs automatically before every commit using [lint-staged](https://github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged). Only staged files are checked:

**For JavaScript/TypeScript files** (`resources/**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}`):
- **Prettier**: Auto-formats code
- **ESLint**: Lints and auto-fixes issues

**For TypeScript files** (`resources/**/*.{ts,tsx}`):
- **TypeScript**: Type-checks without emitting files

**For PHP files** (`{app,bootstrap,config,database,routes,tests}/**/*.php`):
- **Pint**: Auto-formats code according to Laravel standards

**For PHP application files** (excluding tests):
- **PHPStan (Level 6)**: Static analysis to catch bugs

If any check fails, the commit will be blocked. Fix the issues and try again.

### Pre-push Hook

Runs automatically before every push:

1. **Test Suite** (`composer test`): Runs all tests
   - If tests fail, the push is blocked

2. **Rector Analysis** (`vendor/bin/rector process --dry-run`): Checks for potential refactoring improvements
   - If Rector suggests changes, you'll be prompted to continue or abort
   - Run `vendor/bin/rector process` to apply suggestions automatically

### Working with Git Hooks

#### Bypassing Hooks (Not Recommended)
If you absolutely need to bypass hooks:
```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "your message"
git push --no-verify
```

**Note**: Only bypass hooks if you understand the consequences. Your code may not meet quality standards.

#### Running Checks Manually

```bash
# Run lint-staged manually
npm run precommit

# Run individual checks
npm run format          # Format frontend code
npm run lint            # Lint frontend code
npm run types           # Check TypeScript types
vendor/bin/pint         # Format PHP code
vendor/bin/phpstan analyse  # Run PHPStan analysis

# Run test suite
composer test

# Run Rector
vendor/bin/rector process --dry-run  # Check suggestions
vendor/bin/rector process            # Apply suggestions
```

#### Setting Up Hooks (First Time)

Hooks are automatically installed when you run `npm install` (via the `prepare` script). If they're not working:

```bash
npm run prepare  # Reinstalls Husky hooks
```
